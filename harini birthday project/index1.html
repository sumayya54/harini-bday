            <h3>Our School life</h3>
            <h2> First meet</h2>
            <p>The first time we met is actually little bit dramaticðŸ˜‚. we met actually while
                I was crying you were consoling me saying yesterday I too cried the reason is because of section 
               division .At at that we didn't known how much it means to us somethings happens for our good sake.but wait 
               the first I saw u was in class before dividing my first impression was who is this girl with little bit of hair busy in her own world
               you were sitting alone as i remember  I even thought u r lttle bit weirdo ðŸ¤£.but in the end  this weirdo is my world 
              and the best chapter in my life</p>

            <h3>Our Teenage</h3>
            <h2>miss you</h2>
            <p> In 6th class we use to fight and tell each other we will not talk to each other for ethernity and  next second we will be smiling seeing each other faces 
                from that phase to teenage phase where just meeting once a 6months feels like a bliss actually it is  waiting for each other birthdays so that we can meet .
                After completion of School.we both are in different places but still we are close to eaach other I felt like we are never apart.
                may be i am always not there with u but i will be always there for u.
